# **Laptop Data Analysis and Recommender System**

## **📌 Overview**
This project involves **crawling, cleaning, feature extraction, SWOT analysis, and recommendation** for laptops sold by **two of Bangladesh's top computer retailers**:
- **Ryans Computers** (`ryans.com`)
- **Startech Computers** (`startech.com.bd`)

The system scrapes **laptop product details**, cleans the data, extracts key specifications, generates **SWOT analyses using Google Gemini API**, and provides a **personalized recommendation system using LLM embeddings and cosine similarity**.

---

## **🚀 Features**
### **1️⃣ Crawling Laptop Data**
- Scrapes laptop details from **Ryans Computers** and **Startech Computers**.
- Extracts **product name, price, technical details, and descriptions**.
- **Saves raw data** in `data/raw/`.

📂 **Code:**
- [`src/ryans_crawler.py`](src/ryan_crawler.py)  
- [`src/startech_crawler.py`](src/startech_crawler.py) (if added)

---

### **2️⃣ Data Cleaning**
- Converts **Bangla numerals** to **English**.
- Cleans **price** format.
- Removes **unwanted promotional text** from product descriptions.
- Saves **cleaned data** in `data/processed/combined_data_cleaned.xlsx`.

📂 **Code:**
- [`modules/data_cleaner.py`](modules/data_cleaner.py)

---

### **3️⃣ Feature Extraction**
- Extracts key **laptop features** from `Cleaned_Tech_Details`, including:
  - **Processor** (e.g., "Intel Core i5 12th Gen")
  - **RAM** (e.g., "8GB DDR4")
  - **Storage** (e.g., "512GB SSD")
  - **Display** (e.g., "15.6-inch FHD")

📂 **Code:**
- [`modules/feature_extractor.py`](modules/feature_extractor.py)

---

### **4️⃣ SWOT Analysis (Google Gemini API)**
- Uses **Google Gemini API** to generate **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats** (SWOT) for each laptop.
- Saves the **SWOT analysis** as a new column.

📂 **Code:**
- [`generate_swot.py`](swot_generator.py)

---

### **5️⃣ Laptop Recommendation System**
- Uses **Sentence Transformers (Embeddings) and Cosine Similarity** to recommend the **top 3 most relevant laptops** for a given query.
- Stores laptop **embeddings** in a Pickle file (`.pkl`) for efficient lookup.
- Reads **query from a JSON config file** and returns **best-matching laptops**.

📂 **Code:**
- [`modules/laptop_recommender.py`](modules/laptop_recommender.py)
- [`save_embeddings.py`](save_embeddings.py)
- [`recommend_laptops.py`](recommend_laptops.py)
