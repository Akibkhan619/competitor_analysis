SWOT Analysis: If I were to have the same PC I'd love to compare Acer's desktop to a computer but if I had a computer, I would have to compare it to Samsung's desktop.
What I like most in this report is the Intel Performance-Based Test Method used by Intel. As I mentioned I am used to testing the laptop with the same parameters as the Acer Aspire 3, my laptop performance test (from previous laptops) is more up to date.
Note that as is my opinion

SWOT Analysis:
The SKU has become a popular choice with buyers. Over 100% of American customers have ordered a custom computer from ASUS, the only manufacturer they know for an MSI laptop. That’s in good cause for great anticipation. If customers order for an ASUS Intel product, it’s the first time they buy a Krait G5 motherboard. In reality, many SKU customers already have a Krait model now, which may even be slightly cheaper.
